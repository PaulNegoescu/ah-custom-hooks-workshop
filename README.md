This repo serves as the living demo for the workshop held at PeakIT 003.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. [NodeJS 14](https://nodejs.org/en/) (12 also works)
3. Profit ...

### I wanna work just locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulNegoescu/ah-custom-hooks-workshop.git

cd ah-custom-hooks-workshop

npm install
```

### I wanna keep my work for furture reference:

First fork this repo using the fork link on github.

Clone your fork and then:

```
npm install
```

### But I already have a create-react-app installed because Paul told me so!

No worries! Navigate to it and:

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/PaulNegoescu/ah-custom-hooks-workshop.git

git pull

npm install
```

## Working on it

Have ports `3000` and `3001` open!

```
npm start
```

This should also open your browser to the right page.
